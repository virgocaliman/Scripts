Just a basic .vbs logon script to define 2 objects.  Then it will clear the drive mapping in case it already exists on the desired drive letter.  Now that we know the drive is clear it will map a drive letter to a network share using a predefined useraccount and password.  Afterwards it will also connect to a network shared printer, and make it the default.  If you need to add multiple network printers just copy that line and then select which one you want to be the default in the last line.
